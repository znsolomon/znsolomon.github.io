      Day 2: What is HTML, anyway?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Now that we've got a basic site up, it's time to add some text to it! HTML stands for <b>Hyper-Text Markup Language</b>, and it forms the building blocks of every website, from this little thing to social media sites and beyond. 
      <br>
      'Hyper-Text' is just text that can be read by an internet browser. HTML is all about using tags to format the text that you write.
    </p>
    <h2>Tags 101</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>tag</b> is a piece of code that tells HTML how to display the text that lies between tags. Below, you can see an image of this webpage in early development:

    <p>
      Here, you can see tags in action! The '<' and '>' characters mark where a tag starts and ends. Remember that a closing tag has a '/' in it as well!
    </p>
    <h2>
      What tags can you use?
    </h2>
    Here's a list of all the tags I've used so far.
    <ul>
      <li><b>html</b>: Marks the start and end of the document. This tells the web browser you're reading the page on to treat this file as a HTML file, and not as any other type of file.</li>
      <li><b>body</b>: Denotes where the main part of the document is located. Anything not inside the body won't show up on your webpage. Above the body is the <b>head</b> of the document, where non-visible information is located. We'll get back to that one much later.</li>
      <li><b>p</b>: P stands for 'paragraph'! You can absolutely write text without a p tag, but putting your text in paragraphs makes it much easier to format later.</li>
      <li><b>h1, h2...</b>: These are <b>headings</b>, which you use for titles. H1 is the biggest, and they can go all the way down to h6.</li>
      <li><b>ul and li</b>: Ul stands for 'unordered list', and it's how you get bullet points. Li stands for 'list item', and you use it to mark each individual item inside the ul tag.</li>
      <li><b>img</b>: This is how I got that image in up there ^! img is a complicated tag that I'll have a lot more to talk about in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    And that's everything for today! Next time: where did the last page go? And how can we view different versions of the website as it evolves? We'll have to look at a <b>link</b>...
