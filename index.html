      Hello World!
    </h1>
    <p>
      Now, you're probably wondering what this Web 1.0-ass page is doing on a github hosting service.
      I'm doing this because I want to create my own page from scratch, without relying on any other web services like WordPress that let you drag-and-drop the information.
      I want to make this myself. So I'm going to be walking you through each step of how to build a webpage from scratch. 
      If you'd like to work along, we'll be using the HTML and CSS programming languages, as well as some Javascript if we get that far. Strap in!

    <h2>
      So, where do you start?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Well, the first thing to do is to <b>host</b> your webpage. Now, this seems very complicated...
      There are a lot of options to choose from! But let's be honest, we're not making anything requiring fancy features. For now, creating our own Web 1.0 page, we're only writing HTML on a blank document, so we can just use Github Pages.
      You'll want to make a Github account, and then follow the steps here: <a>https://pages.github.com/</a>
    </p>
    That's all for today! Hosting was a pain, so I'll talk more about how to use HTML next time. See you then!
